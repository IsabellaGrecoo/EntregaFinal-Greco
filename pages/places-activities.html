                            <p>Shooting to fame after the Leonardo DiCaprio classic ‘The Beach’ as well as appearing in
                                James Bond.
                                Koh Phi Phi is a stunning island situated in the province of Krabi, this island is a
                                must

                                any trip to Thailand. After visiting this staggeringly beautiful island no beach will
                                ever
                                feel as
                                beautiful. The island has no roads so you will have to do a fair amount of walking but
                                with
                                everything happening between the two main beaches you will never be far from the hive of

                                was being built during the late nineties but due to the global financial crisis the

                            <p>Situated within the Erawan National Park the Erawan Falls are a group of seven waterfalls
                                (the drop
                                from the top waterfall to the bottom one is over 1500m) each having its own distinctive
                                character.
                                The water plunges over lime stone cliffs and into beautiful plunge pools, this has led
                                to
                                the
                                landscape being sculpted by the water and it is truly beautiful. You can spend a whole
                                day
                                in the
                                park trekking from one waterfall to the next, stopping to take a swim in the pools where

                            <p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ayutthaya needs to be on your Thailand to-do list.
                                Originally
                                the
                                capital of Thailand the city was founded in 1350 when King U Thong relocated to the city
                                to
                                escape
                                an outbreak of smallpox. However in 1767 the Burmese army marched on the city and
                                destroyed
                                nearly
                                every part of it. The kingdom collapsed and was never the same again. The ruins of the
                                city
                                are
                                preserved in the historical park and are certainly worth a visit when in the country.

                            <p>The image of Thailand is shaped by countless temples, mile long beaches and impressive
                                elephants.
                                What is quite unknown is the fact that they even have their own letter in the Thai
                                alphabet.
                                The
                                Chor Chang letter can be found in street names, city names or the names of many Thai
                                people.
                                All in
                                all, elephants embody an important part of Thai society. Elephant sculptures are
                                omnipresent
                                in
                                temples, elephant printings decorate the famous fisherman pants and loads of souvenirs
                                with
                                elephant
                                images can be found in Thai shops. It is thus not surprising that the calm giants can be
                                found in
                                tourism, too. Who has not ever dreamed of petting the pachyderms or riding on elephant
                                backs
                                like
                                Mogli from The Jungle Book when visiting a zoo? It is a lovely thought exploring exotic
                                jungles,
                                eating many a coconut, picking some delicious fruits or having a refreshing bath in a
                                waterfall with
                                an elephant. But stop! Let’s come back to reality!</p>

                            <p>Wat Rong Khun, known in English as "the White Temple," is actually not a temple at all or
                                at
                                least
                                not anymore. Abandoned and in ruins, the original Wat Rong Khun was "adopted" by a local
                                artist in
                                the 1990s, who then spent the next few years transforming it into one of the most
                                stunning
                                privately-owned art exhibits in the country. The main building of the temple complex
                                (the
                                usobot) is
                                now a sort of art gallery only accessible by crossing a bridge built over a pond - while
                                some of
                                the other buildings have been designated for meditation and as training rooms and a
                                learning
                                center.
                                And while the former temple is already stunning, renovation work hasn't stopped - and
                                it's
                                not
                                expected to be finished before 2070. The completed compound will consist of nine
                                buildings,
                                including living quarters for monks. Once visitors cross the "gate of heaven," they'll
                                find
                                themselves inside the usobot, which features bright, colorful murals depicting
                                everything
                                from demon
                                faces to Freddy Krueger to Harry Potter. The design is confusing and it's meant to be

                                created it as a representation of humanity: strange, unexpected, and not always gentle.

                                many ways. Built almost entirely of teak wood to look like a cross between a palace, a
                                museum, and a
                                traditional Buddhist wat, the Sanctuary of Truth is the rainchild of a local artist, Mr.

                                Viriyahphan who, inspired by the ancient temples of Ayutthaya, spent a couple of decades
                                designing
                                the structure until his death in the year 2000. Today, it's one of the top things to see
                                in
                                Pattaya.
                                Still growing and under construction, the building was always meant to be a place where
                                philosophy,
                                faith, and art meet and coexist. Both outside and inside the sanctuary, thousands of

                                carvings of mythical creatures, deities, and elephants adorn the walls and the hallways.
