                </a>
                <h3>Check Visa Requirements</h3>
                <p>The visa requirements are different for many countries; some nationalities do not need visas for a
                    stay
                    less than 30 days, some nationalities can obtain their visas when they arrive at the airport, and
                    some
                    nationalities must obtain a visa in advance. Always check the visa requirements for your country to
                    make
                    sure you are allowed to enter Thailand! </p>
                <h3>Pack For Hot, Humid Weather</h3>
                <p>The weather in Thailand is hot and humid. That’s just a fact when considering Thailand travel tips.
                    Unless you are in higher altitudes where the temperature drops a bit, pack plenty of lightweight,
                    breathable warm weather clothes. </p>
                <h3>Prepare to Pay with Cash</h3>
                <p>Paying with cash is much more convenient than paying with a card in Thailand. Street markets, local
                    restaurants, and many tourist attractions usually only accept cash as payment, but luckily ATMs are
                    frequent in touristy areas. Make sure you alert your bank that you’ll be travelling so they don’t
                    assume
                    your transactions in Thailand are a fraud. </p>
                <h3>Verify Companies’ Legitimacy Before Booking</h3>
                <p>Before booking any hostels, guesthouses, volunteer programs, or tours, read customer reviews to make
                    sure
                    it is legitimate. The rise in tourism in Thailand has unfortunately led to a rise in scams and
                    illegitimate businesses that try to get money out of tourists. Just confirm before you book anything
                    that the business is reputable. We recommend using Klook for Thailand. </p>

                    <h2 id="2tip"><b> Cultural Tips </b></h2>
                </a>
                <h3>Remove Your Shoes</h3>
                <p>Feet are considered the dirtiest part of the body in Thai culture. You’ll have to remove your shoes
                    whenever you enter temples, people’s homes, spas, and other establishments, so wear shoes that are
                    easy
                    to slip on and off. </p>
                <h3>Avoid Touching Other People’s Heads</h3>
                <p>The head is considered the holiest part of the body, so you should never touch someone’s head. It
                    seems
                    unlikely that you would touch someone’s head anyway, but just be aware that it is seen as
                    disrespectful
                    so try to avoid that. </p>
                <h3>Dress Respectfully</h3>
                <p>When entering temples, you have to abide by the dress code. In addition to removing your shoes, you
                    have
                    to wear clothes that cover your knees, shoulders, chest and stomach. There is no strict dress code
                    for
                    everyday life, but Thais do tend to dress modestly. Respect their way of life by covering up a bit
                    more.
                    You are perfectly fine wearing shorts and T-shirts when it is hot out, just try to hide areas like
                    cleavage and the midriff so you seem a bit more aware of the Thai modesty. </p>
                <h3>Ask Before Photographing People</h3>
                <p>Before taking a photo of someone, ask for their permission. If you see a local wearing a traditional
                    garment or a monk praying in a temple, this can be a beautiful image to capture. Thais are usually
                    very
                    friendly, so if you ask for a photo they will most likely oblige. If you need more help with this,
                    check
                    out our guide to travel photography tips for beginners. </p>
                <h3>Respect the King</h3>
                <p>Thais love their king. You’ll find posters, monuments, emblems, and other displays of affection with
                    the
                    king’s face plastered on them. All that this means for travellers is to respect monarchy and never
                    say
                    anything negative or offensive about the king.</p>

                <a href="#3.tip">
                    <h2 id="3tip"><b> Budget Travel Tips </b></h2>
                </a>
                <h3>Stay in Hostels</h3>
                <p>Staying in hostels will be cheaper than staying in hotels. This Thailand travel tip can actually
                    apply to
                    any country, but you’ll find hostels in Thailand to cost as little as 6 USD per night. On average,
                    hostels cost between 6 to 13 USD per night. Thailand is such an affordable destination that even
                    nice
                    hotels can be cheap, but you’ll save the most money by staying in hostels.</p>
                <h3>Eat Like The Locals</h3>
                <p>Eat local street food whenever possible! Thailand has some amazing food, and the locals know how to
                    cook
                    it the best. Pad thai, spring rolls, curries, mango and sticky rice, all these essential Thai food
                    dishes you can find in the street. Definitely treat yourself to a few nice Thai restaurants, but
                    you’ll
                    find that the street food tastes the same, if not better than the expensive stuff. Do trust your
                    judgment though. If you have a sensitive stomach, maybe skip the meat and seafood and eat safer
                    street
                    food, like noodles and fruits. </p>
                <h3>Avoid Drinking Too Much</h3>
                <p> Drink responsibly to save money. Partying and buying lots of drinks in bars or clubs always adds up
                    quicker than we’d like to think. If you’re on a tight budget, limit your drinking to a few beers a
                    week
                    and you’ll save a lot. Also be on the lookout for happy hours so you can get discounted drinks, or
                    consider buying some drinks from the liquor store for cheaper prices. Consider just cutting down on
                    drinking in general if you want to save the most money; you’ll also have a clearer head and fewer
                    hangovers so you can enjoy exploring even more.</p>
                <h3>Find the Cheapest Form of Transportation</h3>
                <p>Compare different forms of transportation to find the cheapest option. Thailand has an extensive
                    network
                    of travel options. For travelling short distances you can take a tuk-tuk, rent a motorbike, or hop
                    into
                    a songtaew (red pickup trucks that serve as shared taxis). For travelling long distances, you can
                    take
                    buses, minivans, trains, or planes. One transport option isn’t always cheaper than the others, so
                    ask
                    around, do some research, and try to find the cheapest option before you travel. I recommend you
                    start
                    off by using 12Go.asia as a guide. You’ll often find the best price here, but do your research. </p>
                <h3>Fly Budget Airlines</h3>
                <p>If you plan on flying around the country, choose budget airlines like Nok Air, Lion Air, Air Asia,
                    Vietjet, Orient Thai, or Thai Smile. Any of these reputable airlines can get you across the country
                    quickly and cheaply. They fly into popular cities like Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Phuket, and more.
                    Because
                    budget airlines are so cheap, they often charge extra for other things like food, drinks, and bags.
                    To
                    save the most money, pack your own food and water, and keep your bags to carry-on size. </p>

                </a>
                <h3>Purchase Travel Insurance</h3>
                <p>You never know what will happen abroad, especially if you are taking part in more extreme activities
                    like
                    riding motorbikes, hiking mountains, cliff-jumping, and doing water sports. Even if you don’t plan
                    on
                    doing crazy sports, you still want to be covered in case you get sick.</p>
                <h3>Consult Your Doctor</h3>
                <p>Visit your doctor at home before you visit Thailand. Ask them if they recommend taking any
                    medications or
                    if you need any vaccinations before you go. </p>
                <h3>Don’t Drink the Tap Water</h3>
                <p>The tap water is not safe for drinking in Thailand.Bring a reusable water bottle that you can refill
                    at
                    drinking water stations, or bring your own filter so you can always have clean water. You can buy
                    bottled water during your trip to Thailand, but try to reduce your plastic waste whenever possible!
                </p>
                <h3>Use Sun Protection</h3>
                <p>Always wear sunscreen. Whether you are on the beach, in the city or in the mountains, whether it is
                    sunny
                    or cloudy, just wear sunscreen to be safe.The sun is so strong in Thailand, so you are always at
                    risk of
                    burning, no matter what skin type you have.You may want to bring your own sunscreen from home, as
                    the
                    prices are quite expensive in Thailand. Also, wear sunglasses and a hat whenever possible.</p>

                <a href="#5.tip">
                    <h2 id="5tip"><b> Safty Tips </b></h2>
                </a>
                <h3>Avoid Petty Theft</h3>
                <p>The biggest crime for tourists to encounter in Thailand is just petty theft. To keep your belongings
                    safe, lock your stuff in a safe or locker at your accommodation and try not to bring too many
                    valuables
                    out with you while exploring. Only take as much money as you think you’ll need, and avoid wearing
                    flashy
                    jewelry or expensive watches as it makes you a target for pickpockets. Carry your belongings in a
                    secure
                    bag that you can always have a hand or an eye on, especially when walking through large crowds.</p>
                <h3>Take Caution on Public Transport</h3>
                <p>Also, try to keep your baggage safe when travelling on local buses. Especially on overnight buses or
                    when
                    your bags are thrown up onto the roof of the bus, lock everything up and keep your most important
                    items
                    on your person in a smaller handbag.</p>
                <h3>Stick With a Group</h3>
                <p>Try to avoid walking around alone at night. This is common knowledge, but it is so true. Stick with a
                    group and don’t stray too far from the touristy areas unless you are very familiar with the area. If
                    you’re travelling alone, you’ll be fine to sightsee during the day or check out touristy areas at
                    night
                    on your own. But if you plan on straying off-the-beaten-path, try to find a travel buddy in your
                    hostel
                    to accompany you, especially at night.</p>
                <h3>Be safe on the Road</h3>
                <p>Sometimes road traffic doesn’t seem to have any rhyme or reason, and some locals drive super fast.
                    You’ll
                    see about 10 people on motorbikes in one lane, all packed close together and whipping around
                    corners. It
                    is a bit scary, so always pick bus companies that are reputable so you know you are safe on the
                    road. If
                    you plan on driving in Thailand, either in a rental car or on a motorbike, be very careful at all
                    times!
                    Like I said, local drivers can be crazy so always be aware of them and make sure you drive
                    carefully. On
                    a motorbike, always wear your helmet.</p>

                <a href="#6.tip">
                    <h2 id="6tip"><b> DONT'S In Thailand </b></h2>
                </a>
                <h3>Do Not Flaunt Your Feet</h3>
                <p>Do not use your feet for anything except for walking. As mentioned earlier, the feet are the dirtiest
                    part of the body and doing anything out of the ordinary with your feet is considered disrespectful.
                    That
                    means no putting your feet up on seats, no pointing at things with your feet, and no pushing or
                    moving
                    things with your feet. Keep them pointed away from people, or under your body and out of sight.</p>
                <h3>Do Not Ride Elephants</h3>
                <p>There are lots of companies that exploit animals for the purpose of tourism, which is a sad and
                    horrible
                    reality. Elephants’ spines are made to carry lots of weight underneath them, not above them. That
                    means
                    riding elephants puts lots of stress on their bodies and can be extremely harmful. There are some
                    elephant sanctuaries that rescue elephants and keep them in a safe environment. Here, you can visit
                    with
                    the elephants, photograph them, and observe them without harming them. So if you are eager to see
                    Asian
                    elephants in their natural habitat, always do your research to ensure you are choosing an ethical
                    tour
                    company, and never book a tour that allows you to ride the elephants.</p>
                <h3>Do Not Disrespect the Buddha</h3>
                <p>Buddhism is the main religion in Thailand, so the Buddha is highly revered by locals. When visiting
                    temples and statues of the Buddha, avoid taking any inappropriate or goofy photos and avoid touching
                    the
                    Buddha. You are also not supposed to point your feet directly at the Buddha since the feet are
                    considered dirty. That is why you’ll see locals kneeling with their feet pointed behind them when
                    praying to the Buddha.</p>
                <h3>Do Not Touch the Buddhist Monks</h3>
                <p>Especially if you are a woman, avoid touching the monks in any way. That means no hand-shakes or
                    hugs,
                    and sometimes you can’t even hand them anything; you’ll have to put it on the ground first for them
                    to
                    pick up. Buddhist monks are not allowed to touch women, so, therefore, women should not touch them
                    either.</p>
                <h3>Do Not Stand Taller Than a Monk</h3>
                <p>Do not put yourself in a physically higher position than a monk. If a monk is sitting down, you
                    should
                    not stand next to him, but lower yourself down to his level. The monks are some of the most highly
                    respected people in Thailand, so they take their traditions very seriously.</p>
                <h3>Do Not Make a Scene in Public</h3>
                <p>In Thailand and lots of other Asian cultures, modesty and respect are very important. Try not to
                    attract
                    attention to yourself in any way. That means no screaming, yelling, arguing or fighting, and no
                    excessive public displays of affection. Just carry yourself in a poised and humble manner and you
                    will
                    blend in with the locals more.</p>
