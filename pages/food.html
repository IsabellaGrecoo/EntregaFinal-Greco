                        <p>A typical Thai meal includes five main flavors: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy.
                            Indeed, most
                            Thai dishes are not considered satisfying unless they combine all five. While the seasoning
                            can be
                            spicy for a foreign palate, Thai food ensures that a balance of all flavors is present. When
                            eating
                            out, or making a meal at home, a group of Thai diners would eat a variety of meat and/or
                            fish
                            dishes, plus vegetables, a noodle dish, and possibly soup. Everything is shared, except the
                            soup
                            each person might order, or each person gets a personal bowl to get a serving of the soup.
                            Dessert may consist simply of fresh fruit, such as pineapple or any of the thousands of
                            tropical
                            fruits that are common in the country (guava, durian, mangosteen, papayas, bananas,
                            tamarind, or
                            mangoes, amongs many). Or it could be something more elaborate, like colorful rice cakes,
                            rice
                            dumplings coated in coconut, grass jelly, or a bean dessert. The flavors found in modern-day
                            Thailand come from ancient history. As early as the 13th century, the Thai people had
                            established
                            what might be considered the heart of Siamese cuisine as we know it today: various types of
                            meat and
                            seafood combined with rice,
                            local vegetables, herbs, and pungent garlic and pepper. Later on, the Chinese brought
                            noodles to
                            Thailand,
                            as well as the most important Thai cooking tool: the steel wok.
